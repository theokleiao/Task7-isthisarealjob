I got this information and I applied, then i was requested to pay a certain amount of money for court affidavit and accommodation. In which all the documents given were fake. To make matter worst, the phone number the poster of this job posted here does not exists. These are the real numbers of the so called agency barrister -08097831346 & 08088340885, in which he (poster) claim to be Abubakar Karmu with unassigned number 09097831311, but happens to be barrister Richard Ozeingbe. And email used wejobz001@gmail.com and robertsrichard.esq@gmail.com are not genuine but designed for thus scam work and claim to be at Port Harcourt.
For clarity sake I later called MTN calabar work in center to confirm the so call job in which I was told nothing of such is happening. Also send someone to the center to confirm the story, and he came with no recruitment for now.
For confirmation purpose, this is the real contact to MTN calabar work in center 08032038090.
